Hyperbard is a new dataset presenting diverse relational data
representations derived from William Shakespeare's plays. Our goal is to
show the power of different representations, in particular those that
make use of concepts from hypergraphs.

## Materials

Hyperbard is a work in progress; you can check out our
[data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6627159) or contribute to our
[code](https://github.com/hyperbard/hyperbard).

## Acknowledgements

We are indebted to [The Folger Shakespeare Library](https://shakespeare.folger.edu)
for making all of Shakespeare's plays available in an annotated format
that can be programmatically parsed.
