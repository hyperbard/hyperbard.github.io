Hyperbard is a new dataset of diverse relational data
representations derived from William Shakespeare's plays. 
Our representations range from simple *graphs* capturing character
co-occurrence in single scenes to *hypergraphs* encoding complex communication settings and character contributions as hyperedges with edge-specific node weights.
By making multiple intuitive representations readily available for experimentation, 
we facilitate rigorous *representation robustness checks* in graph learning, graph mining, and network analysis,
highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of specific representations.

## Materials
